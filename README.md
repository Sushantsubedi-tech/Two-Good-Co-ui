# 🚀 Two Good Co UI Clone

A clean and elegant front-end clone of the **Two Good Co** website. This project emphasizes minimal design aesthetics, scroll-based animations using **GSAP**, and fully responsive layouts. It's a part of my learning journey in front-end development and modern web UI/UX techniques.
